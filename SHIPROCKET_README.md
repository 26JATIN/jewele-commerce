SHIPROCKET_EMAIL=your-shiprocket-email@example.com
SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD=your-shiprocket-password
SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_POSTCODE=110001

# Automation Settings
AUTO_SHIP_ENABLED=true
AUTO_SHIP_DELAY_MINUTES=30

# Webhook Security (optional)
SHIPROCKET_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

## API Endpoints

### Shipping Management

#### Create Shipment
```
POST /api/shipping/create
Body: { orderId: "order_id", automate: true }
```

#### Track Order
```
GET /api/shipping/track/{orderId}
POST /api/shipping/track/{orderId} (force update)
```

#### Bulk Operations (Admin only)
```
POST /api/shipping/bulk (bulk tracking update)
DELETE /api/shipping/bulk (cancel shipment)
```

### Webhooks

#### Shiprocket Webhook Handler
```
POST /api/webhooks/shiprocket
```
Configure this URL in your Shiprocket dashboard for automatic tracking updates.

## Automation Workflow

### 1. Order Placement
```
Order Created â†’ Payment Verification â†’ Automatic Shipping Initiation
```

### 2. Shipping Process
```
Create Shipment â†’ Assign AWB â†’ Generate Pickup â†’ Track Updates
```

### 3. Status Updates
```
Webhook Received â†’ Order Status Updated â†’ Customer Notified
```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Shipment Creation
```javascript
import { shippingService } from '@/lib/shippingService';

// Create and process shipment automatically
const result = await shippingService.automateShipping(orderId);
console.log(result); // { shipmentId, awbCode, courier, trackingUrl }
```

### Manual Tracking Update
```javascript
// Update tracking for specific order
const tracking = await shippingService.updateTrackingInfo(orderId);

// Bulk update all active shipments
const results = await shippingService.bulkUpdateTracking();
```

### Order Automation
```javascript
import { orderAutomationService } from '@/lib/orderAutomationService';

// Process new order (automatically called after payment)
await orderAutomationService.processNewOrder(orderId);

// Manual processing
await orderAutomationService.manualProcessOrder(orderId);
```

## Frontend Components

### Tracking Timeline
```jsx
import TrackingTimeline from '@/app/components/tracking/TrackingTimeline';

<TrackingTimeline orderId={orderId} order={order} />
```

### Admin Integration
The admin panel automatically includes shipping management features:
- View all shipments
- Create shipments manually
- Track orders
- Cancel shipments
- Bulk operations

## Cron Jobs & Automation

### Periodic Updates
Run the cron job script for automated maintenance:

```bash
# Update tracking for all active shipments
node scripts/cron-jobs.mjs track-update

# Retry failed shipments
node scripts/cron-jobs.mjs retry-failed

# Check delivered orders
node scripts/cron-jobs.mjs check-delivered

# Run all operations
node scripts/cron-jobs.mjs all
```

### Crontab Setup
Add to your crontab for automatic execution:
```bash
# Update tracking every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/project/scripts/cron-jobs.mjs track-update

# Retry failed shipments every hour
0 * * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/project/scripts/cron-jobs.mjs retry-failed

# Check delivered orders every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/project/scripts/cron-jobs.mjs check-delivered
```

## Webhook Configuration

1. **Login to Shiprocket Dashboard**
2. **Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks**
3. **Add Webhook URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/shiprocket`
4. **Select Events**: All shipment events
5. **Save Configuration**

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Authentication Failures**: Automatic token refresh
- **API Rate Limits**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Network Issues**: Timeout handling and retries
- **Shipment Failures**: Automatic retry queue
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

## Monitoring & Logs

Monitor the integration through:

- **Console Logs**: Detailed logging for all operations
- **Database Records**: Tracking history stored in MongoDB
- **Order Status**: Real-time status updates
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visual monitoring interface

## Status Mapping

| Shiprocket Status | Order Status | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Order Confirmed | processing | Order confirmed in system |
| Pickup Scheduled | processing | Pickup scheduled |
| Picked Up | shipped | Package picked up |
| In Transit | shipped | Package in transit |
| Out for Delivery | shipped | Out for delivery |
| Delivered | delivered | Successfully delivered |
| RTO Initiated | cancelled | Return to origin |
| Cancelled | cancelled | Shipment cancelled |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify SHIPROCKET_EMAIL and SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD
   - Check if Shiprocket account is active

2. **Shipment Creation Failures**
   - Verify pickup location is configured in Shiprocket
   - Check if all required order fields are present
   - Ensure pickup postcode is correct

3. **Tracking Updates Not Working**
   - Verify webhook URL is correctly configured
   - Check if cron jobs are running
   - Ensure database connection is working

4. **AWB Assignment Failures**
   - Check courier serviceability for delivery location
   - Verify package dimensions and weight
   - Ensure sufficient wallet balance in Shiprocket

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```
